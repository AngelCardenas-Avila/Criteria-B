# Criteria-B
TWS: Intellectual property is worth protecting because if things were not protected we would have cheap copies and knockoffs. If it doesn't officially belong to them they should not have access to it.

TWS: We would stop seeing so many fake copies of products.

TWS: Option A: Digital products should be encrypted so if they were ever obtained without legit purchase they would shut down and not be able to be used.

           Option B:Destroy fake copies.

TWS: My first option since no matter what if it is obtained without legally bought the product can not be used.

TWS: The solution is not tangible but it is still effective. Requirements would be for me to know the necessary coding to do this.

DOL: The design is fool proof because it will be included with every digital product
